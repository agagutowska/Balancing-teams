This is a recruitment task for Software Mind.

The primary goal is to develop a solution that divides a group of people into teams of equal size while attempting to balance the teams based on the "rate" of each individual.

I used a sorting mechanism and ArrayList. I also calculated rate standard deviation, wrote some unit tests and created custom exception.
